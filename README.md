# Readily Article App

### <img src="https://github.com/andothergames/stars/blob/main/starss/star3.png?raw=true?" width="16"> What is this Project?

This front-end project was developed whilst studying software development at Northcoders. It is reddit-style article reader site allowing basic log in, comment/vote interactivity and sort by/filter queries to search articles.

Technologies used include React, HTML, CSS and MUI library for some icons/buttons.

I hosted the site using Netlify, feel free to [have a look](https://main--majestic-lollipop-ffb284.netlify.app/)! :frog:
